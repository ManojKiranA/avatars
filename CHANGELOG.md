# Changelog

## [5.0.0] - t.b.a.

### Added

- HTTP-API serverless functions (Apache OpenWhisk)
- JSON Schema for options of core library and avatar styles.
- New documentation page (based on docusaurus 2)
- `@dicebear/avatars`: Util for JSON Schema. See `./utils/schema`.
- `@dicebear/avatars`: New `createAvatar` function, which becomes the central interface. Classes are not used from version 5.0.0.
- `@dicebear/avatars-cli`: CLI for common tasks during avatar style development.

### Changed

- `@dicebear/avatars`: Replaced `seedrandom` with smaller own pseudo-random number generator implementation (utils/prng).

### Removed

- `@dicebear/avatars`: Colors collection
- `@dicebear/avatars`: Random Class. Use `./utils/prng` instead.
- `@dicebear/avatars`: Color modifiers. Use `pure-color` directly instead.
- `@dicebear/avatars`: SVG Parser.
- `@dicebear/avatars`: Default export / class. Use `createAvatar` export / function instead.

## [4.4.0] - 2020-11-11

### Added

- `@dicebear/avatars-avataaars-sprites` New option values for `facialHairColor`: `pastel` and `gray`
- `@dicebear/avatars-avataaars-sprites` New option value for `eyebrow`: `frown`
- `@dicebear/avatars-avataaars-sprites` New option `accessoriesColor`

### Changed

- `@dicebear/avatars-avataaars-sprites` Completely rewritten to remove the `react`, `react-dom` and `avataaars` dependencies. Solves [#48](https://github.com/DiceBear/avatars/issues/48).

## [4.3.0] - 2020-11-06

### Fixed

- Text position was wrong in `@dicebear/avatars-initials-sprites` when a font size was specified.

### Removed

- Code sprites are no longer supported. Too CPU intensive for the HTTP API and does not fit into the future vision of the next major release. Use [qr-image](https://www.npmjs.com/package/qr-image) directly instead.

## [4.2.4] - 2020-07-22

### Fixed

- Types for array options in `avatars-avataaars-sprites`

## [4.2.2] - 2020-07-21

### Fixed

- Type for `topChance` in `avatars-avataaars-sprites`

## [4.2.1] - 2020-06-20

### Changed

- Renamed default branch to `v4`.

## [4.2.0] - 2020-05-26

## [4.1.0] - 2020-05-09

### Added

- [#55][1] Aliases for `width`, `height`, `radius`, `background` and `margin`, to keep the URLs of the HTTP API shorter
- [#66][5] `deterministic` for `gridy` avatars. (thanks to @elierotenberg)
- This changelog

### Changed

- [#55][1] Parameter key for the HTTP API flattened. It is now no longer necessary to nest the values in an `options` object.
- [#61][6] Update `topChange` to `topChance`, clarify some documentation (thanks to @pennstatephil)
- [Configurator][2] now always generates the smallest possible HTTP-API URL.
- Reorganized dependencies in the repository.
- Stackpath CDN configured for HTTP API. Saves 90% traffic to Cloudflare Workers and therefore also unnecessary costs. Unfortunately makes the initial call a bit slower.

### Fixed

- [#69][3] Initial avatars were displayed incorrectly in Firefox. Same solution implemented for all browsers.
- [#58][4] Value `0` did not work for chance options in `bottts`.

### Removed

- `bowser` dependency in initials avatars.
